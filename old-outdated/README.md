This is a previous version of the project, that worked without the:
1. L2 Normalization enbeddings
2. Professional Similarity Thresholds
3. Persistant QDrant DB


It still works to some extent, and requires minimal models (than the new main file), and is a bit faster during the ingestion, in the ingest.py
